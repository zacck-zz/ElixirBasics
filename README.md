# ElixirBasics

**Notes on Learning  Elixir**

Start with src folder for code.

Elixir inherits a lot from `Erlang` and The Erlang Virtual Machine `BEAM`.
It's a new language that runs on Erlangs Virtual Machine.
Erlang Design Goals.

1. Concurrency
2. Fault Tolerance
3. Distribution - Run everywhere.
4. High Availability - Uptime is a priority.

Features.
1. Erlang is a compiled programming language.
2. Immutable state.
3. Functional.
4. Processes as a basic abstraction.
5. Message Passing Concurrency.
6. Process monitoring with automatic restarts.
7. Distributed computing.


Erlang Implementation.
- Erlang Programming language.
- BEAM Virtual Machine
- Tools.

Elixir
Founded in 2009.

Missing features in Erlang.
1. Metaprogramming - It's difficult to extend the language to other domains due to lack of inheritance, its hard to clean boilerplate code.
2. Polymorphism - If you need to extend a library your only option generally is to fork it.

Elixir's Answers!!

1. Macros  - Elixir is built in Elixir.  `defmodule, def, if, unless`.
2. Polymorphism through protocols these are like interfaces in OOP.
3. Frendlier Syntax than Erlang.
4. Better build toos.
